  Notes........:
    3. Change the previous query to use the discount when calculating high-value customers. Order by the total amount which includes the discount.
    2. Find all the high-valued customers. That is find those customers who have made orders totalling $15,000 or more in 1998. If you group by multiple columns those will be factored into your final result, so removed the orderID and OrderDate.
    1. Find all the high-valued customers. That is find those customers who have made at least 1 order within a total value (not including the discount) equal to $10,000 or more. We only want to consider orders made in the year 1998.
    In 1a I only returned 3-results. Maybe this is because my query summed each row, instead of summing each company when they are gruoped. In 1b the real answer reveals 6-rows. This is because the WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregate functions even with a GROUP BY. Ifyou filter data by groups, then you have to add the HAVING clause.

----Limitations of CTEs
--1. CTEs can only be used in the current query scope, meaning they cannot be referenced after the final SELECT
--2. This can be a problem if you need to reuse your virtual tables multi times for diff purposes
--3. cannot be referenced individually, making degugging more difficult
--4. certain optimization techniques are not available to CTEs
