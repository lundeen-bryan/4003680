# SQL Challenges Learn SQL by solving challenging problems

> This readme file serves both to describe this project, serve as a sort-of design-doc, and as a reference for myself to return to when I need to implement a similar solution in a future project. This is a course on Udemy that teaches SQL by going through 150 challenges in different scenarios.

## Description

The course is taught by Kaustubh Sathe who is a Software Engineer in India. He goes through challenges on Leetcode and Hackerrank using databases we can download. On a side note, I like this approach, it is fast and uses real databases to learn. But I would say someone should go through a regular course first maybe that’s why this course is rated a little lower than others in this genre. I personally went through the course using SQL for VSCode but he teaches using SSMS.
